		<h1>You Keep Walking</h1>

		<p>before you know it, you've convinced yourself that it was a hallucination. you wretch your eyes away willing your legs to continue shuffling until the mirror is firmly out of your view. you trudge forward and are met with more waste. ruin and destruction repeats for miles. there seems to be no end to it. a frustrating thrum builds up in your temple the longer you go on, and you grunt petulantly. you can't help but think back to that striking gaze in the mirror. it's... truthfully been the only thing on your mind ever since you tried (and subsequently failed.) to tell yourself it was all in your head. feral...blinding...and so damn surreal... is it really so out of the question for it to be more than a figment of your imagination? in a world like this..? </p><br>
