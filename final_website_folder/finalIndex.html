			<p> they dance across your vision, backoning you to awake. you blink into conciousness, ignoring the fact that eyes seemingly can't open all the the way. it's fine, because it's enough for you to draw the conclusion that you are under rubble. you move your shoulders, attempting to  go through the action of pushing the debris off of you. but the movemnt doesn't come. you try again, body twisting to try and jostle your arms. to no avail. your limbs feel heavy, and your body feels loose, barely held together. you can hardly breathe</p><br>
