		<h1>Your Legs Wabble</h1>


		<p>you look like a newborn faun and you would be embarrassed if there was anyone around to perceive you being embarrassing. well... it was now or never. you lurch up, ignoring how the needles turns into serated scythes hellbent on siphoning through chunks of your distorted body. gasping, you notice that you're standing despite it all. you catch on quickly that your head is functioning as if it's full of lead and you balance it atop your weak shoulders as you take our first shuffling step forward. then another. another. you are moving, albeit very slowly. focusing yours energy into your legs and neck leaves your arms swinging limply at your sides, mimicking a zombie. maybe it's for the best no one is here, they might keel over from fear. without moving your heaad, you blink the fog from your eyes as best you can and proceed to look through your peripherals. it truly is a barren wasteland. structures destroyed beyond recognition, shards of metal from presumbly weapon are scattered across the rough ground and gusts of thick dust blow directly in you face. you restrain the urge to cough, you might still throw up. continuing to shimmy throught the long forgotten battlefield, you labor past a shattered mirror and spot the expanse of your naked body in the corner of your eye. it looks weird though, the skin dulled and and patchy, raw and thick lascerations trail upwards toward a dark mop of damp hair. and a radioactive, yellow eye met yours momentarily. that couldn't be right... whatever that was...should have been you. was that...you..?</p><br>
