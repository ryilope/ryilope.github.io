		<h1>Your Legs Wabble</h1>


		<p>you look like a newborn fawn and you would be embarrassed if there was anyone actually around to perceive it. well... it was now or never. you lurch up, ignoring how the needles turn into serrated scythes hellbent on siphoning through chunks of your distorted body. gasping, you notice that you're standing despite it all. you catch on quickly that your head is functioning as if it's full of lead and you balance it atop your weak shoulders as you take our first shuffling step forward. then another. another. you are moving, albeit very slowly. focusing your energy into your legs and neck leaves your arms swinging limply at your sides, mimicking a zombie. maybe it's for the best no one is here, it would definitely be more trouble than it's worth. without moving your head, you blink the fog from your eyes as best you can and proceed to look through your peripherals. it truly is a barren wasteland. structures destroyed beyond recognition, shards of metal from weapons presumably are scattered across the rough ground and gusts of thick dust blow directly in your face. you restrain the urge to cough, you might still throw up. continuing to shimmy through the long forgotten battlefield, you labor past a shattered mirror and spot the blurry expanse of your naked body in the corner of your eye. it looks weird though, skin dulled and patchy, raw and thick lacerations in flesh trail upwards toward a dark mop of damp hair. and a radioactive, yellow eye met yours momentarily. that couldn't be right... whatever that was...should have been you. was that...you..?  </p><br>
