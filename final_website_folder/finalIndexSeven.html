		<h1>What...</h1>
		<h2>Who Is This..?</h2>


		<p>you stare wide eyed at the person. they stare back as wide as they can through their squinted eyeballs encircled with scrunched, scorched flesh. a side of their mouth is completely blown off, blood rusted teeth and gums peaking out as their jaw hangs slightly ajar. like yours. their body… looking sewn together, scars siphoning off flesh into parts, chunks of skin bubbling over the serrations grotesquely. their arms, littered with similar scarring flop limply at their sides as they saunter closer to the reflection as you do. you don’t recognize you’ve twitched back until the reflection does the same. because there is no use in pretending it is no one but you glaring back from beyond the shattered mirror. the moment the thought crosses your mind, it suddenly throbs in exertion. the pressure causes your head to fall off balance, hitting the mirror. but you remember. you remember it all. <p><br>
