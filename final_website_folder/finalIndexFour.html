		<h1>Your Biceps Tense</h1>

		<p>beginning to shake when you try to summon strength into them. eventually you are able to prop yourself up on your elbows, using that to leverage your legs to tuck under you. you belatedly realize why it's been such a struggle to move all this time: it hurts. a lot. every movement feels like pinpricks of needles stabbing at your flesh and you're now aware of why you couldn't breathe. Your throat constricts with bile as you continue to push your body into motion. you swallow it, push it down. you have one objective: you have to stand. in time, you move your legs underneath your body, and position your feet to lay flat on the rough gravel. and you lift up. when the pressure of your own body threatens to overtake you, you spread your legs farther and breathe through your nose.  </p><br>
